# Reverb_Synth_Sales_Anallysis

In this repo I scrape sales data from the music instrument resale website Reverb using Python, with Beautiful Soup and Selenium. I particularly looked at data from sold instruments in the Synthesizer and Keyboard category. I scraped data for 10 pages, each containing 24 instruments that were sold.

I analyze the data and make inferences based on my analysis using pandas, matplotlib.pyplot and Seaborn.
